# Sprint Challenge: Processes and Scheduling

## Multiple Choice and Short Answer Questions

Add your answers inline, below, with your pull request.

1. List all of the main states a process may be in at any point in time on a
   standard Unix system. Briefly explain what each of these states mean.
   * READY: The process is loaded into main memory and waiting to be executed by the CPU. Usually stored in a ready queue, many processes can be ready at the same time.
   * RUNNING: The process is executed by the CPU. There can only be one running process per core.
   * BLOCKED: The process is waiting for something to happen - an event or a change in state - in order to be ready for execution. Once the process receives the thing it needs it can then be executed.

2. What is a Zombie Process? How does it get created? How does it get destroyed?

    A zombie process is a  process that eats brains. Or, a process that has been executed but still has an entry in the process table. The entry is left in the table to report to the parent process that it's completed. Once the parent process reads the exit status the child process is removed from the process table.

    A child process **always** becomes a zombie prior to being removed from the process table.



3. Describe the job of the Scheduler in the OS in general.
    
    The scheduler's whole purpose and reason for being is to decide which process is executed next. This decision is made by employing an algorithm. Popular algorithms for this task include FIFO, Shortest Job First, and Round Robin.

4. Describe the benefits of the MLFQ over a plain Round-Robin scheduler.

    The Round Robin approach is very fair but can cost performance because the CPU is only doing a bit at a time for every process rather than finishing one process before moving on to the next. The Round Robin is the Oprah of processes - equally generous to everyone but never really taking a stance on the issue.

    The best approach is one that optimizes both response time (how soon the process gets attention from the CPU) and turnaround time (how soon the processes are completed). One of the better solutions to this is the MLFQ. The MLFQ assigns priority levels to individual processes, based upon how the process behaves - it learns from observing behavior. Priority level is primarily set according to how the processes uses the CPU - a project that requires continued input will release the CPU while waiting and come back to the CPU when it has what it needs to proceed. These processes are given high priority because each need for input, each next step must be accomplished quickly. Because the CPU is used in shorter bursts, processes can share the CPU, using it in turns as they need it. If a process is going to hog a lot of CPU for a long time it is given a lower priority to use the CPU more efficiently. Processes are put into queues by priority level and the CPU makes decisions based on the queue a process is in. 



## Programming Exercise: The Lambda School Shell (`lssh`)

This program implements a new shell that you can use to run commands from in
Unix, similar to bash!

At the end of the day, you should be able to run your shell, the run commands within it like so:

```
[bash]$ ./lssh 
lambda-shell$ ls -l
total 32
-rwxr-xr-x  1 beej  staff  9108 Mar 15 13:28 lssh
-rw-r--r--  1 beej  staff  2772 Mar 15 13:27 lssh.c
lambda-shell$ head lssh.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>

#define PROMPT "lambda-shell$ "

#define MAX_TOKENS 100
#define COMMANDLINE_BUFSIZE 1024
#define DEBUG 0  // Set to 1 to turn on some debugging output
lambda-shell$ exit
[bash]$ 
```

General attack is to:

* Loop until the user exits.
  * Print a prompt.
  * Read a line of input from the keyboard.
  * Parse that line down into individual space-separated parts of the command.
  * Fork a child process to run the new command.
  * Exec the command in the child process.
  * Parent process waits for child to complete.

Some of the shell is already written, but you have to write the guts of it.

Examine the `lssh.c` file and:

* Determine which parts of the program do what.
* Read the header comments.
* Find the parts you need to implement.
* Come up with an individual plan of attack for each of those parts.
* Determine how to exit the shell.
* What happens if you build it?
* What happens if you run it?

Resist the urge to start coding until you've done all that and read this
complete challenge.

Hint: you probably want one of the `exec` variants that has the `p` suffix on it
so that the `PATH` will be searched for the file you're trying to run. Choose
your `exec` variant carefully. Some will be hard-to-impossible to use. Some will
be easy.

When you get this working, _you will have your own shell_. It's not as
full-featured as bash, by any means, but it is a legitimate shell and the core
is the same as any other shell.

If you finish early, look at extra credit to start implementing more features.

### Extra Credit: Change Directories with `cd`

In bash, you can change directories with the built-in `cd` command.

Each process keep track of which directory it is running in, and the shell is no
exception. Each process can change its current directory, as well.

> Why is `cd` built into the shell? Why can't it run as an external command?

Because it is built in, you should check to see if the user entered `cd` in
`args[0]` _before_ running the command. And if they did, you should
short-circuit the rest of the main loop with a `continue` statement.

> Look at the implementation of the built-in `exit` command for inspiration.

You can use the program `pwd` to see what directory you are in.

Example run:

```
lambda-shell$ pwd
/Users/example
lambda-shell$ cd src
lambda-shell$ pwd
/Users/example/src
lambda-shell$ cd ..
lambda-shell$ pwd
/Users/example
lambda-shell$ cd foobar
chdir: No such file or directory
lambda-shell$ 
```

If the user entered `cd` as the first argument:

1. Check to make sure they've entered 2 total arguments
2. Run the system call `chdir()` on the second argument to change directories
3. Error check the result of `chdir()`. If it returns `-1`, meaning an error
   occurred, you can print out an error message with:
   ```
   perror("chdir"); // #include <errno.h> to use this
   ```
4. Execute a `continue` statement to short-circuit the rest of the main loop.

Note that `.` and `..` are actual directories. You don't need to write any
special case code to handle them.

### Extra Credit: Background Tasks

In bash, you can run a program in the background by adding an `&` after the
command.

```
ls -la &
```

Add similar functionality to `lssh` by checking to see if the last argument is
an `&`.

If it is:

1. Strip the `&` off the `args` (by setting that pointer to `NULL`).
2. Run the command in the child as usual.
3. Prevent the parent from `wait()`ing for the child to complete. Just give a
   new prompt immediately. The child will continue to run in the background.

Note that you might get weird output when doing this, like the prompt might
appear before the program completes, or not at all if the program's output
overwrites it. If it looks like it hangs at the end, just hit `RETURN` to get
another prompt back.


### Extra Credit: File Redirection

In bash, you can redirect the output of a program into a file with `>`. This
creates a new file and puts the output of the command in there instead of
writing it to the screen.

```
ls -l > foo.txt
```

Check the `args` array for a `>`. If it's there:

1. Get the output file name from the next element in `args`.
2. Strip everything out of `args` from the `>` on. (Set the `args` element with
   the `>` in it to `NULL`).
3. In the child process:
    1. `open()` the file for output. Store the resultant file descriptor in a
       variable `fd`.
    2. Use the `dup2()` system call to make `stdout` (file descriptor `1`) refer
       to the newly-opened file instead:

	    ```c
		int fd = open(...
		dup2(fd, 1);  // Now stdout goes to the file instead
		```
	3. `exec` the program like normal.

### Extra Credit: Pipes

In bash, you can pipe the output of one command into the input of another with
the `|` symbol.

For example, this takes the output of `ls -l` and uses it as the input for `wc
-l` (which counts the number of lines in the input):

```
ls -l | wc -l
```

This uses the `pipe()` system call.

Use a process similar to the above extra credit challenges, along with [this
description of how to implement pipes in
C](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/How-Unix-Pipes-are-Implemented)
to get pipes implemented in `lssh`.
